# DinnerSpinner 

Time is precious. This is what this app is used for.

This app is designed to help users decide what the restaurant they should go for lunch or dinner. After the user clicks on the 
front page, the spinner will appear. The user can enter the zipcode to indicate the location. Once the user clicks the button, the spinner should spin. As it stops, the restaurant type will display in the middle of the spinner and three choices will show 
next to the spinner. 

If the user clicks on the map button, it will direct the user to the google map with three markers. If user clicks on the marker, the restaurant info will then be displayed next to the marker on the map. 

This can help individuals save a lot of their time deciding where they want to go for lunch and dinner.
